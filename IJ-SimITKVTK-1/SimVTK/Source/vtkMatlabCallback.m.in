function Sim@FILTER_NAME@Callback(action,block)

%% Use function handle to call appropriate callback
feval(action,block)

%%all callbacks work almost identically so first is commented to explain
%%what is happening and rest follow same principle.
%%At end of file is a function to output the current ports labelled
%%properly, which is called after any indicator callback to ensure that the
%%port labels are always up to date.  Currently goes through entire MaskValues
%%list and creates a new label scheme for the current set-up, as it seems
%%impossible to change them individually, as you can never be sure where in
%%list it should go without actually going through all the MaskValues to
%%see its proper position based on the currently showing inputs.  (Ie.
%%can't tell how many inputs are supposed to be before it without actually
%%going through the MaskValues to see what the user wishes to leave as
%%input.)
